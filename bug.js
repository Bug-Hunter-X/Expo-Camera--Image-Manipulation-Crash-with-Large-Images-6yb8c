This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom image processing.  The problem arises when trying to access pixel data from the image after capturing it.  Specifically, the `takePictureAsync` function returns an image URI which is then loaded using `ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync`. The `manipulateAsync` function can crash or produce unexpected results if the image processing pipeline is not structured correctly, particularly for large images or complex operations.  This can manifest as a silent crash, an incorrect result in the image manipulation, or a memory leak.
