# Expo Camera Image Processing Crash

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's Camera API related to image processing.  When using `takePictureAsync` with `ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync` for large images, inconsistent crashes or unexpected behavior may occur. This is particularly noticeable when performing pixel-level manipulation.

## Problem Description

The core issue lies in how Expo handles image data transfer and processing, especially when manipulating large images.  Accessing pixel data directly after capture may trigger memory issues or exceptions, leading to application crashes.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app using Expo Go.
4. Capture an image (larger images have a higher probability of triggering the crash).
5. Observe the application's behaviorâ€”it may crash, return an incorrect image, or exhibit other unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves optimizing image handling and processing.  This includes reducing the image resolution before processing, employing asynchronous operations, or using more memory-efficient image manipulation libraries.  The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates these techniques. 

## Additional Notes

This bug seems to be related to memory management within Expo's Camera API. It may only be evident with a specific device and image size.
